# A brief description of what the module does.
description: Plugin that allows crud control over IML IntelliJ files.

# "System" in this case will be the host project for this module.
system: client-android

# The "owner" should be the squad that maintains the client container
# (iOS Infra, Marvin, etc). Not every squad has an LDAP group. Until
# that is the case, I think it makes sense to use this default.
owner: nycinfra

# If your module can be included by other modules not owned by your
# squad, this should be set to "public". There aren't too many cases
# where "private" would be necessary on the client-side.
visibility: public

# This is a required field. I'd say that it's OK to leave this empty
# to begin with, but we should probably flesh them out eventually so
# system-z can draw pretty dependency graphs.
dependencies: []

# Facts are optional key-value pairs. A few of these are standardized,
# but all are optional.
facts:
  # Standard. The slack channel for support. Optional but recommended.
  slack_channel: nyc-infra

  # Standard. Support email address.
  support_email: nyc-infra@spotify.com

  # Standard. Jira feature name.
  jira_feature: Infrastructure [Marvin / Foundation]

  # Standard. System-Z uses these string tags for grouping similar services.
  tags: ['android']

  # Custom: An array of GHE-taggables. This can be a list of individuals
  # and/or org teams. This can be used to configure mention-bot to always
  # tag this list of people when files change in the directory where
  # service-info.yaml lives.
  mentionbot:
    #GHE usernames or groups.
    users: [android/nyc-infra]
    # specifies a list of relative file globs to match
    # if null or omitted, will recursively own all files in the folder containing this yaml file
    # paths: [] # see alwaysNotifyForPaths in mention-bot config (optional)
